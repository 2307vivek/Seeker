# Seeker
**Seeker** is a highly customisable seekbar/slider for android with support for **readahead indicator** and **segments**. Made with Jetpack Compose ‚ù§.

### Gradle
Add the dependency below to your **module**'s `build.gradle` file:
```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation 'io.github.2307vivek:seeker:1.0.1'
}
```

## How to use
You can create a Seeker with the `Seeker` composable.
```kotlin
@Composable
fun Seeker(
    modifier: Modifier = Modifier,
    state: SeekerState = rememberSeekerState(),
    value: Float,
    range: ClosedFloatingPointRange<Float> = 0f..1f,
    readAheadValue: Float = range.start,
    onValueChange: (Float) -> Unit,
    onValueChangeFinished: (() -> Unit)? = null,
    segments: List<Segment> = emptyList(),
    enabled: Boolean = true,
    colors: SeekerColors = SeekerDefaults.seekerColors(),
    dimensions: SeekerDimensions = SeekerDefaults.seekerDimensions(),
    interactionSource: MutableInteractionSource = remember { MutableInteractionSource() },
)
```

In its simplest form **seeker** can be used as a regular slider for selecting values from a range or showing progress in a range.

```kotlin
var value by remember { mutableStateOf(0f) }

Seeker(
    value = value,
    range = 1f..100f,
    onValueChange = { value = it }
)
```

### Read Ahead indicator
A read ahead indicator shows the amount of content which is already ready to use. It is particularly useful in media streaming apps where some media is downloaded ahead of time to avoid bufferring. The `readAheadValue` property of the Seeker composable can be used to display the read ahead indicator.

```kotlin
var value by remember { mutableStateOf(0f) }
var readAheadValue by remember { mutableStateOf(0f) }

Seeker(
    value = value,
    readAheadValue = readAheadValue,
    range = 1f..100f,
    onValueChange = { value = it }
)
```
